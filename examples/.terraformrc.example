# Example .terraformrc configuration for local development
# Copy this file to ~/.terraformrc and update the path to match your Go bin directory
#
# To find your Go bin directory, run: go env GOBIN
# If GOBIN is empty, use: go env GOPATH and append /bin
#
# After updating this file:
# 1. Run `make install` in the provider directory to build and install the provider
# 2. Navigate to examples/data-sources/naming/
# 3. Run `terraform init` (you may see warnings about dev overrides - this is expected)
# 4. Run `terraform plan` to see the provider in action

provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "registry.terraform.io/abes140377/homelab" = "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/go/bin"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly as normal.
  direct {}
